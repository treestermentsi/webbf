In this article, we will show you how to use the Digital License Activation Script 7.0 to activate Windows 10 with a few simple steps. We will also explain what is a digital license, how it works, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of using this method.
 
## What is a Digital License?
 
A digital license is a new activation method introduced by Microsoft since Windows 10. It is also known as a digital entitlement or a device-based activation. A digital license is linked to your device and your Microsoft account, and it does not require a product key or an activation server.
 
A digital license is generated when you upgrade to Windows 10 from an eligible device running a genuine copy of Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, or when you purchase a new device that comes with Windows 10 preinstalled. You can also get a digital license when you sign in to Windows 10 with your Microsoft account that has a valid license for Windows 10.
 
A digital license allows you to activate Windows 10 on the same device without entering a product key. You can also use it to reactivate Windows 10 after reinstalling the OS or changing some hardware components, such as the hard drive or the motherboard. However, if you change too many hardware components at once, or if you install a different version/edition of Windows 10, then you may need to enter a product key or contact Microsoft support to reactivate Windows 10.
