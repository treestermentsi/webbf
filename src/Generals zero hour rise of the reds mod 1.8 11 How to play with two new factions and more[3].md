Generals Zero Hour: Rise of the Reds is a must-have for any fan of Command and Conquer: Generals Zero Hour who wants to experience a fresh and challenging gameplay with new content and features. The mod is constantly being updated and improved by the dedicated SWR team, who also plan to add new campaigns and generals in the future versions. The mod can be downloaded for free from Mod DB or the official website.
  
One of the new factions added by the mod is the Russian Federation, a resurgent superpower that seeks to reclaim its former glory and influence in the world. Led by President Nikolai Suvorov, a former opposition leader who overthrew the corrupt regime of Vladimir Putin, Russia has modernized and reformed its military and economy, and has become a formidable force on the global stage. Russia relies on heavy tanks, powerful weapons and a strong army to defeat its enemies, and has access to unique technologies such as Tesla coils, magnetic weapons and orbital strikes.
 
The Russian Federation has three tiers of technology, each unlocking new units and abilities. The first tier consists of basic infantry and vehicles, such as Conscripts, RPG Conscripts, BMPs and T-90s. The second tier introduces more advanced units and upgrades, such as Tesla Troopers, Buratino rocket launchers, Golem tanks and Blackout missile systems. The third tier unlocks the most powerful and expensive units and abilities, such as Shock Troopers, Topol-M ballistic missiles, Sentinel tanks and the Orbital Drop support power.
 
The Russian Federation also has several unique features that set it apart from other factions. For example, Russia can deploy Forward Command Posts to expand its territory and gain access to additional support powers. Russia can also use its Industrial Plant to reduce the cost and build time of its vehicles, as well as repair them for free. Russia can also deploy several defensive structures, such as Bunkers, Stinger Sites, Tesla Coils and Shilka AA guns. Finally, Russia can use its Airfield to call in various aircraft for support, such as MiGs, Hinds, Berkuts and Bears.
